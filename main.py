# Programmers:  Donovan, Jalen
# Course:  CS151,
# Due Date: november 20th
# Lab Assignment:  lab10
# Problem Statement:
# Data In: file, decisons
# Data Out:  table, updsated file, highest or lowest
# Credits:
# Input Files: [description of the format of the input files you need for this program to work]


# Purpose:  use the table to write onto a file with proper formatting
# Parameters: output_filename, table
# Return: updated movies

# Purpose:  read the file into a table and change index 2 and 4 to integers
# Parameters: filename
# Return: table
